# To Do Application
This is a simple To Do application using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/).

You can find the running demo [here](https://hosseintalebi.github.io/to-do-list/).

In order to run the project locally, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm installed on your machine. You can clone the repository and then change your directory to "to-do-list". From "to-do-list" directory, run `npm install` to install the dependencies and then `npm start` to start the project.
